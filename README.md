# Drupal dev env based on Docker
> Run Drupal **8.x.x** from Docker containers

## Running the project

* First, Drupal must be pulled from the web and configured
```bash
make build-drupal
```
* Build the Docker image
```bash
make
```

* Spin up the containers
> During this stage, the PostgreSQL image will be pulled
```bash
make up
```
:boom: And that's it, you got yourself a fully-functional Drupal website on
localhost without wasting time to install _Apache + PHP + Drupal_ on your machine.

## Credentials
The following credentials are used along the installation:
* **DB_USERNAME:** `drupal`
* **DB_PASSWORD:** `drupal`
* **DB_DATABASE:** `drupal`
* **DB_HOSTNAME:** `drupaldocker_psql_1`

#### Note for DB_HOSTNAME
In case there are problems with the host of the db, do `docker ps` and copy the NAME of
the DB Docker container

## Other commands
```bash
make down     # stop containers

make in       # enter the Drupal container

make restart  # restart containers

make clean    # remove containers and all local docker images
```
